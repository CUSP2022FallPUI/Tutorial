    "# Python code conventions: style guide\n",
    "While some syntax rules in Python need to be followed precisely (like line identation or starting a variable name with with a letter of \"_\"), there is still a lot of flexibility otherwise and thus some space for further guidelines and conventions for unifying the style of the code. Those won't be enforced by the compiler, so not following them won't be considered a syntax error, but might be still a good idea to follow making your code easy to read and creating impression of a professional product following common standards."
